- Terms / Names -  
  Datalog ------ a query language used for databases
  Datascript --- a flavor of Datalog written in Clojure. Logseq currently uses Datascript.
  Datomic ----- a different flavor of Datalog written in Clojure. (Some tutorials for Datomic may be helpful, but ymmv)
  Hiccup ------- a language used to generate HTML, you can use it in an advanced query's custom view ( :view )

- Official Docs -  
  https://logseq.github.io/#/page/queries
  https://logseq.github.io/#/page/advanced%20queries
  https://logseq.github.io/#/page/hiccup

- Datalog -  
  http://www.learndatalogtoday.org/
  http://www.learndatalogtoday.org/chapter/0
  When reading through this, I realized that viewing some of the query keywords as relationships between objects, made everything make a lot more sense/intuitive

- Datascript -  
  https://github.com/tonsky/datascript/wiki/Getting-started
  https://github.com/tonsky/datascript#resources

- Datomic -  
  https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/query/query.html#syntax-used-in-grammar
  Only some info here may be applicable, but I found the syntax section to be helpful in understanding the meaning of all the brackets used in queries (like: [ ], { }, ( ), etc.)

- Logseq's Database Schema -  
  https://github.com/logseq/logseq/blob/master/src/main/frontend/db_schema.cljs
  Here you can see how the database is structured and all the keywords (you may recognize some keywords from example queries)

from @Avijeet in Logseq's discord #.v-border-children

- Hi, I have compiled a list of advanced queries and references from this channel, which I was able to execute for my database (still need to add those from the last few weeks). Thought it might be useful to those looking for advanced queries examples. Link to the original discord message and dates are also included for context 🙂.

- [[Logseq/Advanced_queries_Examples]]

from @cldwalker in Logseq's discord #.v-border-children

- There is a handy new query feature in the nightly build - the ability to use any of these simple query rules, https://github.com/logseq/logseq/blob/2e340ca1c6d73731275d526c09e94d8d9e44214e/src/main/frontend/db/rules.cljc#L61-L141,

- in an advanced query. Here is an example query - https://github.com/logseq/logseq/blob/ed6a02c6921f6605d6c2482ca013f81de9c16b01/src/test/frontend/db/query_custom_test.cljs#L26-L29 .

- While the rules have the same names as the operators in simple queries, their arguments can be different. Examples of their arguments are at https://gist.github.com/logseq-cldwalker/796202d55897fd34ea3d8c3bb3401ae0

- `:keys` logic for query:
  https://github.com/tonsky/datascript/blob/master/docs/queries.md#return-maps

{:title [:h2 "Commitments"]
:query [:find (pull ?b [*])
       :in $ ?start ?today ?tag
       :where

           [?ref :block/name "othertag"])

       ]
 :inputs [:7d-before :today "TAG1"]}

Sorting based on a block property

```clojure
    - query-table:: false
      query-properties:: [:alias :birthday]
      #+BEGIN_QUERY
      {
       :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
            :where
            [?b :block/properties ?bprops]
            [(get ?bprops :birthday "nil") ?bs]
            [(not= ?bs "nil")]]
      :result-transform (fn [result]
          (sort-by (fn [h]
            (get-in h [:block/properties :verjaardag])) result))
      }
      #+END_QUERY
```

---

Display today page through query dynamically based on today's date

```clojure
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title "Scheduled items"
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
        :in $ ?today
       :where

            [?b :block/scheduled]
            [(get-else $ ?b :block/priority "NIL") ?prio]
            [(get-else $ ?b :block/marker "NIL") ?marker]
            [(not= ?marker "DONE")]
            [(not= ?marker "CANCELED")]
               [(not= ?marker "LATER")]

               [(get-else $ ?b :block/scheduled ?today) ?d]
            [(>= ?d ?today)]

        ]
        :inputs [:today]
        :breadcrumb-show? false
        :result-transform (fn [result]
            (sort-by (fn [h]
            (get h :block/priority "Z")
            )
             result))
          :collapsed? false
}
#+END_QUERY
```

Capture all the quotes

- Logseq has two ways you can write quotes, you only match one, this should do the trick:

```clojure
#+BEGIN_QUERY
 {:title "QUOTE search"
  :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
  :where
   [?b :block/content ?c]
   (or [(clojure.string/includes? ?c "#+BEGIN_QUOTE")]
       [(clojure.string/starts-with? ?c "> ")]
   )]}
#+END_QUERY
```

---

Query for all the blocks which have a block property = current page, use the name of current page dynamically instead of fixing it on each page

- the page name have to be `lowercase`.

```clojure
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:query [
 :find (pull ?b [*])
 :in $ ?current-page
 :where
  [?p :block/name ?current-page]
  [?b :block/page ?p]
  [?b :block/path-refs [:block/name "datalog"]]
  ]
 :inputs [:current-page]}
}
#+END_QUERY
```

- you can use `:block/name` or `:block/original-name` to differentiate, but the first is always lowercase (afaik), so it's not a good habit (on Logseq) to depend on differences in case.

```clojure
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:query [:find (pull ?e [*])
:in $ ?current-page
:where
[?b :block/marker ?marker]
[(contains? #{"TODO" "LATER" "NOW" "DOING"} ?marker)]
[?e :block/properties ?prop]
[(get ?prop :projects) ?value]
[(contains? ?value ?current-page)]
]
:inputs [:current-page]
:result-transform (fn [result]

  (sort-by (fn [h]
      (get h :block/priority "Z")) result))
:collapsed? false}}
#+END_QUERY
```

find block which are highlighted with ==

- sol. 1

```clojure
#+BEGIN_QUERY
 {:title "Highlight search"
  :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
  :where
   [?b :block/content ?c]
   [(clojure.string/includes? ?c "==")]
   ]}
#+END_QUERY
```

- sol. 2

```clojure
#+BEGIN_QUERY
 {:title "Highlight search"
  :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
  :where
   [?b :block/content ?c]
   [(re-pattern "{{< logseq/mark >}}.*{{< / logseq/mark >}}") ?regex]
   [(re-find ?regex ?c)]
   ]}
#+END_QUERY
```

---

Show scheduled or deadline only on today's journal

```clojure
#+BEGIN_QUERY

  :find (pull ?b [*])
  :in $ ?current-page

  [?p :block/name ?current-page]
  [?p :block/journal? true]
  [?p :block/journal-day ?date]
  (or
   [?b :block/scheduled ?date]
   [?b :block/deadline ?date]
  )
  (not [?b :block/marker])
 ]
 :inputs [:current-page]}
#+END_QUERY
```

---

Query the block & page title of certain pages or tags

 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
       :in $ ?page_name
       :where
       [?b :block/refs ?r]
       [?r :block/name ?page_name]]
       :inputs

As I'm using NOW/LATER + WAITING approach, my common workflow for tasks life cycle is:

- add something not urgent (and visually "muted") with WAITING without date
- add common task with LATER + plan it if needed with deadline\scheduled
- add current\urgent task with NOW --> work on it --> finish with DONE
- take overdued tasks
- take some LATER task --> delete planed date if it was --> set it to NOW --> work --> finish with DONE

I was trying to mix 2 layers of tasks planning as you can see - task status cycle and "calendared" items:

- "what is overdued?"
- "what should I do today?"
- "what should I do tomorrow?"
- "what can I do next?"
- "what is WAITING?"

  - **PS**: no sorting in queries, as i want to see parent pages links 😒 #.v-gallery-h400-fit

- ✅ wanna have block answering my question "what is overdued?"
  - anything task calendared before today
  - also as this block can called "attention" - I'm searching for "wrong" tasks calendared NOW(it should no have date, as described before)

```clojure
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{
    :title
        [[:strong "🔥 Overdue"] [:span " or "] [:span.block-marker.NOW "NOW"] [:sup "(with-date)"]]
    :query [

        :in $ ?start ?next
        :where
            [?block :block/marker ?m]
            (or-join [?block ?start ?next ?m]
                (and
                    (or [?block :block/scheduled ?d] [?block :block/deadline ?d])
                    [(> ?d ?start)]
                    [(< ?d ?next)]

            )
        ]
        :inputs [:365d-before :today]
        :breadcrumb-show? false

#+END_QUERY
```

- ✅ wanna have block answering my question "what should i do today?"
  - not calendared status NOW = today
  - status LATER with date today

```clojure

- just tested it with different journal-date format. replace `[?p :block/name ?n]` with `[?p :block/original-name ?n]`. date value are stored in property with `original-name`.

```clojure
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title ["Unreleased Shows"]
 :query [:find (pull ?p2 [*])
         :in $ ?today
         :where
         [?p2 :block/name _]
         [?p2 :block/properties ?prop]
         [(get ?prop :release) ?rel]
         [?p :block/original-name ?n]
         [(contains? ?rel ?n)]
         [?p :block/journal-day ?d]
         [(> ?d ?today)]
         [(get ?prop :type) ?type]
         [(contains? #{"series"} ?type)]
         [(get ?prop :status) ?status]
         [(= #{"towatch"} ?status)]]
 :inputs [:today]}
#+END_QUERY

Have a `property` field that I only fill with numbers (floats). Is it possible to pull blocks where this field is within a range (say 20 < x < 50, or just x > 100).

- [Discord Link](https://discord.com/channels/725182569297215569/743139225746145311/966146506392473640)

```clojure
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{
 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :where
         [?b :block/properties ?prop]
         [(get ?prop :num-prop) ?num]
         [(> ?num 100)]
       ]
}
#+END_QUERY
```

- for 20<x<50 replace `[(> ?num 100)]` with

```clojure
         [(< ?num 50)]
         [(> ?num 20)]
```

- float function doesn't recognized, so multiply property by 1.0

```clojure
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{

 :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :where
         [?b :block/properties ?prop]
         [(get ?prop :num-prop) ?num]
         [(* 1.0 ?num) ?numf]
         [(< ?numf 50)]
         [(> ?numf 20)]
       ]
}#+END_QUERY
```
